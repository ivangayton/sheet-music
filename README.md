# songs
Songs I write, music I transcribe, and other resources.

## How it works
Everything is text files. The ```.chord``` files are compiled with Chordpro, and the ```.ly``` files are compiled with Lilypond (usually embedded within Frescobaldi).

### Chordpro
The format is obvious, and the chordpro website has lots of instructions to write.

The incantation to compile is

```
chordpro /path/to/text-file.chord -t 16
```

(in this case it's printing with a text font size of sixteen).

### Lilypond
Deep rabbit hole. Descend if you dare.

Fun though! And creates beautiful engravings.
