Why should I be nice to folks who want to hurt my friends?
A civic-minded thing I 'spose but then it never ends

Tucker says that I should listen while they bitch and whine
Tucker says that Martin Luther King would take his side

Take your fucking rebel flag and stick it up your ass
Decency demands that I not let your bullshit pass

Punch a Nazi in the nose and push his buddies down
The folks he wants to hurt should know you don't want him around

Take your fucking MAGA hat and stick it up your ass
Humanity demands that I not let your hatred pass
