Gold watch, diamond ring
I ain't missin' not a single thing
Cufflinks, stick pin
When I step out, I'm gonna do you in
They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man (uh huh)

Top coat, top hat
But I don't worry 'cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white gloves
Lookin' sharp, lookin' for love
They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man
(Oh-huh, you can't lose with the dress I use)
(That's right, real fine)
