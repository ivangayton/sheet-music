[Gm7]Down around the corner
'Bout half a mile from here
See them long trains runnin'
And you watch 'em disappear

{soc}
[Cm7]Without love
[Cm6]Where would you be [Gm7]now?
(Without [Eb7]loooo[Gm/D]oooo[D7]ove)

You know I saw Miss Lucy
Down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family
And she won't be coming back

{soc}
Without love
Where would you be right now?
(Without love)
{eoc}

Well, the Illinois Central
And the Southern Central freight
Got to keep on pushin' mama
'Cause you know they're runnin' late

{soc}
Without love
Where would you be right now?

Well, pistons keep on churnin'
And the wheels go 'round and 'round
And the steel rails lie cold
And hard on the mountains they go down

{soc}
Without love
Where would you be right now?
(Without love)
{eoc}

Ooh, where would you be now?

Mmm, got to get you baby-baby
Won't you move it down?
Won't you move it down?
Baby-baby-baby-baby
Won't you move it down?

When the big train run
When the train I'm movin' on
I got to keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Won't you keep on movin'?
Won't you keep on movin'?
