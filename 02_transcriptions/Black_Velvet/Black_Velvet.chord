{comment: intro}
[Dm]
[Dm]Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky
[A]The boy could sing, knew how to [G]move, everything
[F]Always wanting more, [C]he'd leave you longing for

[G]Black velvet and that [C]little boy's smile
[G]Black velvet with that [Eb]slow southern [Bb]style
[G]A new religion that'll [C]bring ya to your knees
[Bb]Black [A]velvet if you [Dm]please

Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl
"Love me tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle
The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

[G]Every word of every [A]song that he sang was for [Dm]you
[G]In a flash he was [Eb]gone, it happened so [Bb]soon, what could
You [A]do? [D]

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please

Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
If you please, if you please, if you please
