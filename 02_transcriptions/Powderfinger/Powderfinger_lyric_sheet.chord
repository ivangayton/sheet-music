[G]Look out, Mama, there's a [C]white boat coming up the [G]river [C] [G]
[C]With a big red beacon and a flag and a man on the [G]rail [C] [G]
I think you'd [C]better call John
'Cause it don't look like they're here to [Em] deliver the [C]mail
And it's [Bm]less than a [C]mile away
I [Bm]hope they didn't come to [C]stay
It's got [Bm]numbers on the side and a [C]gun
And it's makin' big [D]waves [D]

[G]Daddy's gone, my [C]brother's out huntin' in the [G]mountains [C] [G]
Big [C]John's been drinkin' since the river took Emmy [G]Lou
So the [C]powers that be left me here to do the [E]thinkin' [C]
And I [Bm]just turned twenty-[C]two
I was [Bm]wonderin' what to [C]do
The [Bm]closer they came, the [C]more those feelings [D]grew [D]

[G]Daddy's rifle in my [C]hand felt reas[G]surin'
He told me [C]"Red means 'run', son, the numbers add up to [G]nothing." [C] [G]
When the [C]first shot hit the dock, I saw it [Em]comin' [C]
Raised my [Bm]rifle to my [C]eye
Never [Bm]stopped to wonder [C]why
Then [Bm]I saw black and my [C]face splashed in the [D]sky [D]

[G]Shelter me from the [C]powder and the [G]finger
[C]Cover me with the thought that pulled the [G]trigger
Just [C]think of me as one you never [Em]figured
Would [Bm]fade away so [C]young
With [Bm]so much left un[C]done
Re[Bm]member me to my [C]love, I know I'll [D]miss her [D]
