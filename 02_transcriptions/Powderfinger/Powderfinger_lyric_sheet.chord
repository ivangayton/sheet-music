[G]Look out, Mama, there's a [C]white boat coming up the [G]river [C] [G]
[C]With a big red beacon and a flag and a man on the [G]rail [C] [G]
I think you'd [C]better call John
'Cause it don't look like they're here to [Em] deliver the [C]mail
And it's [G]less than a [C]mile away
I [G]hope they didn't come to [C]stay
It's got [G]numbers on the side and a [C]gun
And it's makin' big [D]waves [G] [C] [G] [C] [G]

Daddy's gone, my brother's out huntin' in the mountains
Big John's been drinkin' since the river took Emmy Lou
So the powers that be left me here to do the thinkin'
And I just turned twenty-two
I was wonderin' what to do
The closer they got, the more those feelings grew

Daddy's rifle in my hand felt reassurin'
He told me, "Red means 'run', son. Numbers add up to nothing."
But when the first shot hit the dock, I saw it comin'
Raised my rifle to my eye
Never stopped to wonder why
Then I saw black and my face splashed in the sky

Shelter me from the powder and the finger
Cover me with the thought that pulled the trigger
Just think of me as one you never figured
Would fade away so young
With so much left undone
Remember me to my love, I know I'll miss her
