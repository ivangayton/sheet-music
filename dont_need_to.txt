I, I don't need to run,
I don't need to fly
I don't need to see that doggie

I, I don't need to dance,
I don't need to smile
I don't need to lie down for a while

I don't need to know,
I don't have to go
I don't need to understand this, no

I don't need to cheat ,
I don't need to speak
I don't need to turn the other cheek

  CHORUS
  We all need each other but it's sometimes hard to say
  Maybe we can tell each other in a different way  


I don't need to cry,
I don't need to crawl
I don't need to cover wonderwall

I don't need a ride,
I think I'll just drive
I don't wanna share a seat
 
I don't need a hand,
I don't need to hide,
I don't need my sister by my side

I don't need to brush,
or think about my health
I don't need to take care of myself

CHORUS 

I don't need to write
I don't need to draw
I don't need to do my homework

I don't need to try
I'm not feeling blue
I don't need to make my wish come true

I don't need to stay
I don't want to wait
I don't think your house is all that great

I don't need to swear,
I don't even care,
I don't need to get it all out
