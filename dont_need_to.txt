I, I don't need to run, I don't need to fly
I don't need to see that doggie

I, I don't need to dance, I don't need to smile
I don't need to lie down for a while

I don't need to know, I don't have to go
I don't need to understand this

No, I don't need to cry, I don't need to crawl
I don't need to see that wonderwall

I don't need to cheat, I don't need to speak
I don't need to turn the other cheek

I don't need a ride, I think I'll just drive
I don't wanna share share a seat

I don't
