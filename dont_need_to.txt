I, I don't need to run,
I don't need to fly
I don't need to see that doggie

I, I don't need to dance,
I don't need to smile
I don't need to lie down for a while

I don't need to know,
I don't have to go
I don't need to understand this

No, I don't need to cheat,
I don't need to peek
I don't need to turn the other cheek

I don't need to cry,
I don't need to crawl
I don't need to cover wonderwall

I don't need a ride,
I think I'll just drive
I don't wanna share a seat

I don't need a hand,
I don't need to hide,
I don't need my sister by my side

I don't need to brush,
or think about my health, no
I don't need to take care of myself 

I don't need to swear,
I don't even care,
I don't need to get it all out
