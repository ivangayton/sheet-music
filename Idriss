They came to the village in the night
When Idriss was nine

The Presidential Guard with their engines off
and lights on low

The sparks from the burning huts
mingled with the stars in the clear black sky
and the screams from his father
and his mother and his brother as they burned rang high

The rebels gave him food and a gun
when Idriss was nine

They told him he would never stand alone
and they would help him fight

The smoke from the burning cars
rose above the noise to the clear blue sky
with the screams from the soldiers and the rebels
and the guns as the villagers died

he said: I will have a life, or I will die trying
I will have a life, or I will die trying

I met him on the shores of the Med
when he was twenty nine

His boat went down with everyone on board
but Idriss survived

The diesel and the shit in the water in the boat
burned their skin and their faces and their eyes
and they cried as the helicopter disappeared 
and left them in the burning sun to die

I asked him what he figured he would do
he said another try

He said I know I probably won't make it
but this is not a life

The sparks from the burning huts
were remembered in the gleam in his flashing dark eyes
and the screams he carried with him in the silence 
and they drove him every day of his life

he said: I will have a life, or I will die trying
I will have a life, or I will die trying

We'll sink or we'll stand but our lives are our own
You don't get to say who we are
We only demand that our lives are our own
You don't get to say who we are
