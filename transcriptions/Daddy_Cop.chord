Is that a baton in your pocket
Or are you just happy to see me?
She puts the short in shorty
And he looks like he wants to chase me

Cop cuties, cute and on duty
Navy blue booties
Go ahead and lock me up
Arrest me but make it sexy
Arrest me but make it sexy

Put me in the back of your car
And we'll start a verbal flirtation
I'm doing tax fraud and arsons
Now take me down to your station

Cop cuties, cute and on duty
Navy blue booties
Go ahead and lock me up
Arrest me but make it sexy
Sell me some meth please
So I can get arrested by this daddy of a cop
With his daddy cop walk
And his daddy cop arms and his daddy cop butt
Cop cuties, cute and on duty
Cop cuties, cute and on duty

I've got my own cuffs
Let me lock you up
I've got my own cuffs
Let me lock you up
I've got my own cuffs
Let me lock you up
They're made of pink fluff
Let me lock you up

Arrest me, but make it sexy
Arrest me, but make it sexy, yeah
