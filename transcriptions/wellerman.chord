{title: Wellerman}

[Dm]There once was a ship that put to sea
And the [Bb]name of that ship was the [Dm]Billy o' Tea
[Dm]The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down oh
[Am]Blow, me bully boys, [Dm]blow (Hah!)

[Am][Beat drop 2 bars]

[Chorus (repeat after each verse)]
{soc}
[Bb5]Soon may the Wellerman [F5]come
To [G5]bring us sugar and [D5]tea and rum
[Bb5]One day, when the [F5]tonguin' is done
We'll [A5]take our leave and [Dm]go
{eoc}

She had not been two weeks from shore
When down on her, a right whale bore
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow (Hah!)

Before the boat had hit the water
The whale's tail came up and caught her
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
When she dived down low (Huh!)

[Solo (chords of 1 verse and 1 chorus)]

No line was cut, no whale was freed
The Captain's mind was not on greed
But he belonged to the whaleman's creed
She took that ship in tow (Huh!)

For forty days, or even more
The line went slack, then tight once more
All boats were lost, there were only four
But still that whale did go

As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone
The Wellerman makes his a regular call
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all
