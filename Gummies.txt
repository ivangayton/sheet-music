I don’t like sharing gummies 
get your darn hands off my snack
I’m going to eat them by myself
so you should just stand back

I see you sitting there and looking 
at my gummie bears
No matter how much you complain
I’m never going to share

The gummie bears are mine and I 
think you should get your own
If you take one I will call 
your mommy on the phone

If you touch my snack then I’ll
eat every crumb of yours
And leave you in the lunch room and 
I’ll lock up all the doors
