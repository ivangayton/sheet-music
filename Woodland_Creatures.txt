2X INTRO

Imagine a scene with all the woodland creatures and they're
Running around in the grass and trees and the flowers
Imagine a scene with university students and they're they're
Dancing with now only bedsheets draped round their bodies
Imagine a scene with iron, coal, and steam where the
Humans have taken the life and dreams from the water

CHORUS
You wanna see them, you gotta open your eyes and
If you catch them, you gotta take 'em alive and
If you want it, you better keep a surprise because the winner
Is the one who's satisfied

2X INTRO

Imagine a scene in the protected green where the
woodland creatures are safe at last in the wild
Imagine a scene involving you and me in which we
know that the answer is not what it seems like at all
Imagine a scene beside a bubbling stream where the 
Humans are taking the water and leaving only bottles

REPEAT CHORUS

4X SOLO

Imagine a scene with all the woodland creatures and they're
Running around in the grass and trees and the flowers
Imagine a scene with university students and they're they're
Dancing with now only bedsheets draped round their bodies
Imagine a scene with iron, coal, and steam where the
Humans have taken the life and dreams from the water
